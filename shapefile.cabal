synopsis:               Parser and related tools for ESRI shapefile format
description:            A very simple interface for processing data in ESRI 
                        shapefile format.  Includes functions for reading or  
                        writing whole .shp and .shx files, as well as for
                        generating .shx index files from .shp data files.
                        Also includes an interface to read individual records
                        on-demand from shapefiles, useful for very large databases.
